Data Science Internship Projects at SyncTech Innovations
This repository contains the code and notebooks for my data science internship projects at SyncTech Innovations.
Project 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
 Objective:  This project investigates the impact of feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning on the performance of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for Iris flower classification.
 Data: The project leverages the built-in Iris dataset from scikit-learn, which contains measurements of three Iris flower species (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) and
 their corresponding class labels.
 Algorithm: Feature Engineering and Hyperparameter Tuning with KNN 

Project 2: EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
 Objective:This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify Email messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using the Naive Bayes classification algorithm.
 Data: The project will utilize the SMS Spam Collection dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled SMS messages (spam or ham) and their content.
 Algorithm: Naive Bayes Classification
 
Project 3: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
 Objective:The primary aim of this analysis is to assess the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on India's job market. 
 The dataset under consideration contains crucial information about the unemployment rates across various Indian states
 Data: The datasets explains the unemployment and employment rate in percentage for different states in India for last one year and it is taken from Kaggle.
 Algorithm: Naive Bayes Classification
